## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main Streamlit application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                    # Environment variables (ignored by git)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore              # Git ignore rules
â”œâ”€â”€ example.txt             # Sample finance tips (optional)
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Verify that your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is valid and has access to Gemini.
- **Dependency Issues**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.
- **Port Conflicts**: Streamlit runs on port 8501 by default; change it with `--server.port` if needed.

## How It Works

1. User inputs monthly income, expenses, and savings goal.
2. The app builds a prompt incorporating this data.
3. Prompt is sent to Google Gemini via LangChainâ€™s `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.
4. Gemini returns personalized finance tips.
5. Tips are displayed in the Streamlit UI.
