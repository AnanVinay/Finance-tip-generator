## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/finance-tip-generator.git
cd finance-tip-generator
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
PORT=5000
```

### 5. (Optional) Add Finance Examples

You can create a `finance_examples.txt` file with budgeting and saving examples to improve AI responses.

Example format for `finance_examples.txt`:

```
[Basic Budget Tip]
  Allocate at least 20% of your monthly income towards savings and investments.

[Savings Motivation Example]
  Building an emergency fund with 3-6 months of expenses provides financial security.

[Expense Reduction Suggestion]
  Track subscription services and cancel those you rarely use to free up extra cash.
```

### 6. Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit the app at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                    # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/                # HTML templates (index.html)
â”œâ”€â”€ static/                   # CSS or JS assets
â”œâ”€â”€ finance_examples.txt      # (Optional) RAG example data
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                      # Environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Dependencies

- Flask  
- python-dotenv  
- langchain  
- google-generativeai  
- faiss-cpu  
- numpy  

### Install them all with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Error**: Ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is correct and has access to Gemini.  
- **FAISS Installation Issues**: If errors occur, reinstall `faiss-cpu` or switch to `faiss-gpu` if your system supports it.  
- **Port Conflict**: Modify the `PORT` value in `.env` if `5000` is in use.  

## How It Works

1. Finance examples from `finance_examples.txt` (if provided) are loaded and chunked using `CharacterTextSplitter`.  
2. Chunks are embedded using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` and stored in FAISS for fast similarity search.  
3. User submits financial inputs via the form.  
4. Relevant examples + user input are sent to Gemini using a structured prompt.  
5. Gemini generates personalized finance advice displayed to the user.
